/**
 * LABORATORY EXERCISE #4
 * Write a program that inputs the hourly rate and number of hours worked. 
 * Compute and display the gross pay (hourly rate * hours worked), 
 * your withholding tax, which is 15% of your gross pay 
 * and your net pay (gross pay â€“ withholding tax). 
 * Sample output : 
 * Hourly rate : 104.65
 * Hours worked : 22
 * Gross pay : 2302.3
 * Withholding tax : 345.345
 * Net pay : 1956.955
